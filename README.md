# Train-Scheduler

## Using Firebase and Moment.js.

### What is this?

This Train Scheduler site is a project that I built as one of 
The UT Coding Boot Camp assignments, and is meant to demonstrate knowledge of Firebase and Moment.js.

### What does this do?

**The site uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) to host arrival and departure data, and is able to retrieve and manipulate the information with [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/).**

Users enter Train Name, the time of the First Train stop, the Frequency of the train, and their Destination. 

The app then give information on the Next Train Arrival:

* The app calculates the hours and/or minutes until the next train. 
    
* The exact time of the arrival.

* Shows a countdown for the arrival of the last submitted train information.


All inputted train information is stored in the Firebase database and is prepended to the form on the site for other users to view as well.
